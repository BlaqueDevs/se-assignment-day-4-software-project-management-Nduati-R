## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
It ensures customer satisfaction, reduces costs, and maintains competitive advantage. Project managers can meet deadlines using clear planning, agile methodologies, risk management, and progress tracking.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
It  prevents overspending, maximizes resource use, and ensures profitability. Strategies include budget forecasting, continuous monitoring, cost-benefit analysis, and using project management tools.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology is flexible, iterative, customer-focused. 
Pros: Faster feedback, adaptability. 
Cons: Requires constant collaboration, difficult in fixed-budget projects.
Waterfall methodology is structured, sequential.
Pros: Clear documentation, well-defined phases. 
Cons: Rigid, hard to adapt to changes.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile methodology is suitable for dynamic projects like app development (e.g., WhatsApp updates) while Waterfall is best for projects with fixed requirements, like banking software.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Regular testing, peer reviews, automated tools, and user feedback. Ensures reliability, security, and user satisfaction.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
The project scope clarifies objectives, prevents scope creep. WBS breaks projects into manageable tasks, improving organization and efficiency.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
It aids with time management, resource allocation, and tracking. Gantt charts visually map tasks, dependencies, and progress.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Identifies user pain points and inefficiencies, ensuring relevance and demand.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Defining the problem provides clarity, sets development goals, and ensures alignment with user needs.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
By focusing on the impact the solution hae e.g: "A platform that simplifies movie ticket booking, reducing waiting time."

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Unique functionalities like AI integration, automation, security enhancements, or intuitive UI.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
